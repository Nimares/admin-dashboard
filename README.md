Lessons learned:
    * inline SVG offers nice customization options
    * using a combination of nested svg, and display: flex, and transform on links create for enlarge hover effects
    * Leave color pallet for last OR create fullmockup and styleguide before page creation. 
    * Use SVG sparingly, otherwise your HTML will be cluttered
    * use flexbox and grid when needed. each have their strengths. 
    * using border on element that changes sizes can cause border warping in unwanted ways.
