Ideas/Suggestions
    * Apply all new css concepts learned
        - Fun with units / responsive design
        - alternative fonstacks / fallback var colors
        - background options? linear gradient?
        - tailwind color pallets 



Lessons learned:
    * inline SVG offers nice customization options
    * using a combination of nested svg, and display: flex, and transform on links create for enlarge hover effects
    * Leave color pallet for last OR create fullmockup and styleguide before page creation. 
    * Use SVG sparingly, otherwise your HTML will be cluttered
    * use flexbox and grid when needed. each have their strengths. 
    * using border on element that changes sizes can cause border warping in unwanted ways. 
    * rely more on reusable class names rather than continously more specific selectors and combinators
    * First complete the assignment, then add your own personal touch. Scoop creep will ruin your productivity
